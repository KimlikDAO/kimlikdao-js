 * If they are unable to do either (because they lost their private keys and
 * did not set up social revoke), they need to get a new DID and file an
 * exposure report at https://kimlikdao.org/report using the new DID.

 * with the contract directly and the above interface is merely a convenience.
 *

 * delay function, therefore for maximum privacy, one may choose to discard an
 * EVM address used for an `exposureReport`.
